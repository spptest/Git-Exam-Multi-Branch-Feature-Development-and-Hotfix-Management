# Git Workflow Example

This project demonstrates a standard Git workflow with multiple feature branches, a hotfix, and a clean commit history using interactive rebasing.

## Branches Created

- `main`: The main branch.
- `feature-auth`: For authentication-related features (login/logout).
- `feature-dashboard`: For UI improvements on the dashboard.
- `hotfix-security`: For resolving a critical security bug introduced in `main`.

## Workflow Steps

1. Initialized the repository with an initial commit.
2. Created `feature-auth` and `feature-dashboard` branches.
3. Made multiple commits to each feature branch:
   - `feature-auth`: login, logout features.
   - `feature-dashboard`: dashboard welcome, stats.
4. Switched to `main` and introduced a critical bug.
5. Created `hotfix-security`, fixed the bug, and merged it back into `main`.
6. Merged both feature branches into `main`, resolving conflicts as needed.
7. Used interactive rebase to ensure a clean and linear commit history.

## Notes

- This repo follows a structured Git strategy to support parallel development and quick bug fixing.
- Interactive rebase was used to tidy up the commit history before final merges.
